summary    : Docmake - a Perl-based tool to Render DocBook/XML
description: |
    Docmake is a command line tool to translate DocBook/XML code into various resultant formats such as XHTML, RTF, PDF and XSL-FO, using the more low-level tools. It aims to be a saner replacement, written in Perl, for xmlto, which is written in Unix shell and had a maintenance lull at the time.
