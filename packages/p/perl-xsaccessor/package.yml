summary    : Generate fast XS accessors without runtime compilation
description: |
    Class::XSAccessor implements fast read, write and read/write accessors in XS. Additionally, it can provide predicates such as has_foo() for testing whether the attribute foo exists in the object (which is different from "is defined within the object"). It only works with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes. Class::XSAccessor::Array implements the same interface for objects that use arrays for their internal representation.
