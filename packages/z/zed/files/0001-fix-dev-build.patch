Subject: [PATCH] fix dev build

This is an optional convenience patch that allows you to build the zed package with `--profile dev` which is much, **much** faster than the release build.

This is useful when you want to experiment with changes and iterate quickly without waiting forever for each build. Without this commit zed will fail to launch as it needs resource files embedded in the binary that are skipped for debug/dev builds.
