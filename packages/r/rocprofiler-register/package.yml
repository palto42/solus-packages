summary    : ROCprofiler (v2) API interception coordination helper library
description: |
    The rocprofiler-register library is a helper library that coordinates the modification of the intercept API table(s) of the HSA/HIP/ROCTx runtime libraries by the ROCprofiler (v2) library. The purpose of this library is to provide a consistent and automated mechanism of enabling performance analysis in the ROCm runtimes which does not rely on environment variables or unique methods for each runtime library.
