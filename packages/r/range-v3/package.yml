summary    : Range library for C++14/17/20, basis for C++20's std::ranges
description: |
    Range library for C++14/17/20. This code was the basis of a formal proposal to add range support to the C++ standard library. That proposal evolved through a Technical Specification, and finally into P0896R4 "The One Ranges Proposal" which was merged into the C++20 working drafts in November 2018.
