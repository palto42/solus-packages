      Cinelerra is an NLE – Non-Linear Editor – for Linux that provides a way to compose audio and video media. Besides editing, it can be used as an audio/video player, for recording audio or video to include broadcast television programs, creating dvd/bluray media, and touching up old photos. Because cinelerra has many features for uncompressed content, high resolution processing, and compositing, using cinelerra can be quite complex. However, with only a little bit of introduction, even a novice will be able to create simple artful videos.
