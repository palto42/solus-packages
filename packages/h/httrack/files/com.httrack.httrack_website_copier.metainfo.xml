      HTTrack is an offline browser utility, allowing you to download a World Wide website from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting html, images, and other files from the server to your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTTrack arranges the original site&apos;s relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the &quot;mirrored&quot; website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online.
